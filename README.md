# Smart-Home-Arduino-Remote-Controller(SHARC)

## Introduction

In this project, we have developed an android app to remotely control the home appliances like door lock, fan, light & blinds and get notified about fire/smoke & water-level of tank. The android app communicates with Arduino board to handle all these appliances. Android app has two modes MANUAL and AUTOMATIC. In manual mode, person will give instruction to a particular appliance through android app using bluetooth technology and on the other hand in automatic mode, working of each appliance is controlled by sensors.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project to automate the "HOME", in order to make the life of a person comfortable, easy & safe.
